A small Android project using Kotlin with Dagger / Hilt for dependency injection and Room database to store our notes.
The idea is to have the possibility to store a Note with a title and description for the note, we can see the exact date the note was added.
Also we can remove any note that not longer needed for any purpose.
The notes being stored locally using the Room database, for each note we have got a unique key in which is of type UUID.
